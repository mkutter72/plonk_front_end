## Background Information on Plonk.  Will be displayed on website
What is Plonk? Plonk is a non-specific and derogatory term used for wine.
The term is not always used in a wholly derogatory manner. It can indicate a degree of strange affection for the wine in question.

What is The Plonk Exchange? How many times have you had guests over that bring that obligatory bottle of gift wine?   Unless they know you well, chances are that bottle will end up orphaned in your basement somewhere.    It might see the light of day when you take that bottle over to a friends house to unload it, usually at a large party where noone will notice. Those days are gone!  Now The Plonk Exchange you can sell or trade that plonk and give that wine a loving home.  One person's plonk is another person's treasure.
